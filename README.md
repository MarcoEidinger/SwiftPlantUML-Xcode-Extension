## Troubleshooting

### The command "Open editable diagram in browser" is still busy

Xcode Source Code Extension initialization might take up ~ 30 seconds on initial launch.

If the prompt does not appear within 60 seconds

then check for a crash report related to XPC service in Console app of your MacOS.

If you see such crash report related to `fatal error: Loading sourcekitd.framework/Versions/A/sourcekitd failed` please check the installation path of Xcode. If it's installed under `/Applications/Xcode.app`, please run:

```
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```

If it's installed elsewhere, please replace the `/Applications/Xcode.app` path in the command above with the location where you've installed Xcode.


## Technical Details

This Source Editor Extension makes use of XPC service to run the app sandboxed and use `SwiftPlantUML` (and its dependency `SourceKitten`). Source Editor Extensions using `SourceKitten` (either directly or indirectly) have to either run in a non-sandboxed app (and could not be distributed via the App Store) or use XPC service to outsource the use of `SourceKitten` to a different process.
